Here are some elementary school-level facts about animals living on Greenland:<\/p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus):<\/strong> Greenland is known for its polar bears, the largest land carnivores. These bears are well adapted to the Arctic environment and are excellent swimmers. They primarily hunt seals on sea ice.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus):<\/strong> The Arctic fox is another resident of Greenland. It has a thick fur coat that changes color with the seasons, helping it to blend into the snowy landscape. It feeds on small mammals and birds.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus):<\/strong> Reindeer, also known as caribou, can be found in some parts of Greenland. They are well adapted to the cold and have large hooves that help them walk on snow.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Arctic Hare (Lepus arcticus):<\/strong> These hares have a white fur coat in winter, providing them with camouflage in the snowy environment. In summer, their fur turns brown to match the surroundings.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Seals:<\/strong> Various seal species, such as the harp seal and ringed seal, inhabit the waters around Greenland. They are well adapted to swimming in icy waters and often use ice floes for resting and giving birth.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Whales:<\/strong> Greenland's coastal waters are home to whales, including species like the humpback whale and the minke whale. These whales migrate to the area to feed on the rich marine life.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>Sea Birds:<\/strong> Greenland is an important breeding ground for several seabird species, such as the common eider and the northern fulmar. They nest on cliffs and rocky shores.<\/p>\n\t<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n<p>It's important to note that Greenland's wildlife has adapted to extreme cold conditions, and these animals have unique features that help them survive in the Arctic environment.<\/p>\n"},"library":"H5P.AdvancedText 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text"},"subContentId":"04e9cd04-e1f6-4509-8c08-480c42c075e4"},"specialStageExtraLives":1,"specialStageExtraTime":1},{"id":"9bb634d7-8b6c-4abc-9d9a-a5f465d7f41f","label":"Animals on Greenland quiz","telemetry":{"x":"25.998483045032767","y":"15.618319507866751","width":"4.375","height":"7.556179377807371"},"neighbors":["0","3"],"type":"stage","canBeStartStage":false,"time":{},"accessRestrictions":{"openOnScoreSufficient":false},"contentType":{"params":{"media":{"disableImageZooming":false},"answers":[{"correct":true,"tipsAndFeedback":{"tip":"","chosenFeedback":"","notChosenFeedback":""},"text":"<div>Seals and other marine mammals<\/div>\n"},{"correct":false,"tipsAndFeedback":{"tip":"","chosenFeedback":"","notChosenFeedback":""},"text":"<div>Grass and plants<\/div>\n"},{"correct":false,"tipsAndFeedback":{"tip":"","chosenFeedback":"","notChosenFeedback":""},"text":"<div>Fish and crustaceans<\/div>\n"},{"correct":false,"tipsAndFeedback":{"tip":"","chosenFeedback":"","notChosenFeedback":""},"text":"<div>Insects and small rodents<\/div>\n"}],"overallFeedback":[{"from":0,"to":100}],"behaviour":{"enableRetry":true,"enableSolutionsButton":true,"enableCheckButton":true,"type":"auto","singlePoint":false,"randomAnswers":true,"showSolutionsRequiresInput":true,"confirmCheckDialog":false,"confirmRetryDialog":false,"autoCheck":false,"passPercentage":100,"showScorePoints":true},"UI":{"checkAnswerButton":"Check","submitAnswerButton":"Submit","showSolutionButton":"Show solution","tryAgainButton":"Retry","tipsLabel":"Show tip","scoreBarLabel":"You got :num out of :total points","tipAvailable":"Tip available","feedbackAvailable":"Feedback available","readFeedback":"Read feedback","wrongAnswer":"Wrong answer","correctAnswer":"Correct answer","shouldCheck":"Should have been checked","shouldNotCheck":"Should not have been checked","noInput":"Please answer before viewing the solution","a11yCheck":"Check the answers.
